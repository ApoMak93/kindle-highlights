Any method  of negotiation  may  be fairly judged by three criteria: It should  produce a wise agreement if  agreement is possible. It  should be efficient.  And  it should improve  or at least  not damage the  relationship  between  the parties.  (A wise agreement can be defined as one which meets the legitimate interests of each side to the extent possible, resolves conflicting interests fairly, is durable, and takes community interests into account.)

The game of negotiation takes place at two levels. At one level, negotiation addresses the substance. The first negotiation may concern your salary, the terms of a lease, or a price to be paid. The second negotiation concerns how you will negotiate the substantive question: by soft positional bargaining, by hard positional bargaining, or by some other method.

A  basic fact about negotiation, easy to forget in  corporate and  international transactions, is that you are dealing not with  abstract  representatives of the "other side," but with  human beings. They have emotions, deeply held values,  and different  backgrounds and viewpoints; and they are unpredictable. So  are  you.

Often in a negotiation people will continue to hold out not because the proposal on the table is inherently unacceptable, but simply because they want to avoid the feeling or the appearance of backing down to the other side. If the substance can be phrased or conceptualized differently so that it seems a fair outcome, they will then accept it.

Perhaps the best strategy to adopt while the other side lets off steam is to listen  quietly without responding to their attacks, and occasionally to ask the speaker to continue until  he has spoken his last word. In this way, you offer little support to the inflammatory substance,  give the speaker every encouragement to speak himself out, and leave little or no residue to  fester.

Second, the proof is in the pudding. It is impossible to predict how well you will work with a given VA without a trial. Luckily, there are things you can do to improve your odds, and one of them is using a VA firm instead of a solo operator.

If you're having a hard time locating a supplier, you can always use the old order-from-the-competition trick. Here's how it works: Find a competitor you think is dropshipping and place a small order with that company. When you receive the package, Google the return address to find out who the original shipper was. In some cases, it will be a supplier you can contact.

That said, supplier directories are a convenient way to quickly search for and/or browse a large number of suppliers in one place and are great for brainstorming ideas for products to sell or niches to enter. If you're short on time and are willing to spend the money, they can be a helpful tool.

Many consider it a good tactic not to give the other side's case too much attention, and not  to admit any legitimacy in their point of view. A good negotiator does just the reverse. Unless  you acknowledge what they are saying and demonstrate that you understand them, they may  believe you have not heard them.

Most entrepreneurs begin with the cheapest tools available, bootstrapping and doing things themselves to get up and running with little cash. This isn’t the problem. In fact, it’s necessary so that the entrepreneurs can train outsourcers later. The problem is that these same entrepreneurs don’t know when and how to replace themselves or their homemade infrastructure with something more scalable.

Henry Ford once said, referring to his Model-T, the bestselling car of all time,56 “The customer can have any color he wants, so long as it’s black.” He understood something that businesspeople seem to have forgotten: Serving the customer (“customer service”) is not becoming a personal concierge and catering to their every whim and want. Customer service is providing an excellent product at an acceptable price and solving legitimate problems (lost packages, replacements, refunds, etc.) in the fastest manner possible. That’s it. The more options you offer the customer, the more indecision you create and the fewer orders you receive—it is a disservice all around. Furthermore, the more options you offer the customer, the more manufacturing and customer service burden you create for yourself.

First, limit intense exercise to no more than about twenty minutes in duration and focus on brief bouts of significant anaerobic exertion, interspersed with brief periods of recovery at a slower pace that is sufficient for a return to the resting heart rate. This can be done via sprinting, cycling, rowing, elliptical machines, and many other methods. Or, it can be done using kettlebells (my personal favorite), weights, or calisthenics in which muscles are, after warming up, challenged close to their peak capacity for a very few sets.

But contrary to what you might think, it has the lowest glycemic index of all the natural sugars. The reason is simple: Because the liver metabolizes most of the fructose, it has no immediate effect on our blood sugar and insulin levels, unlike sugar or high-fructose corn syrup, whose glucose ends up in general circulation and raises blood sugar levels. Don’t let that fact fool you, however.

Sugars in particular are rapid stimulators of glycation, as they easily attach themselves to proteins in the body (and here’s a good bit of trivia: The number one source of dietary calories in America comes from high-fructose corn syrup, which increases the rate of glycation by a factor of ten). When proteins become glycated, at least two important things happen. First, they become much less functional. Second, once proteins become bonded to sugar, they tend to attach themselves to other similarly damaged proteins and form cross-linkages that further inhibit their ability to function.

Earlier I explained that LDL—the so-called bad cholesterol—is an important carrier protein bringing vital cholesterol to brain cells. Only when it becomes oxidized does it wreak havoc on blood vessels. And we now understand that when LDL becomes glycated (it’s a protein, after all), this dramatically increases its oxidation.

But they may possibly be led to, if we are gentle and friendly, ever so gentle and ever so friendly. Lincoln said that, in effect, over a hundred years ago.

‘The average person,’ said Samuel Vauclain, then president of the Baldwin Locomotive Works, ‘can be led readily if you have his or her respect and if you show that you respect that person for some kind of ability.’ In short, if you want to improve a person in a certain respect, act as though that particular trait were already one of his or her outstanding characteristics.

Half of the battle is knowing you want to be with a woman who wants to please you, not one who feels obligated to. You will never draw this genuine desire from her by overt means, but you can covertly lead her to this genuine desire.

Learn this now: Women never want full disclosure. Nothing is more self-satisfying for a woman than to think she’s figured a Man out based solely on her mythical feminine intuition (i.e. imagination). When a man overtly confirms his character, his story, his value, etc. for a woman, the mystery is dispelled and the biochemical rush she enjoyed from her imaginings, her suspicions, her self-confirmations about you are gone. Most guys with a Beta male mindset classically do exactly this on the first date and wonder why they get LJBF’d promptly after it – this is why. Familiarity is anti- seductive. Nothing kills Game, organic passion and libido like comfortable familiarity. Despite their common filibuster tactics, women don’t want to be comfortable with a potential (or proven) sex partner, they need their imaginations stoked to be excited, aroused and anxious to want sex with

This requires covertly, tactfully, demonstrably implying that other women find you desirable. Women crave the chemical rush that comes from suspicion and indignation. If you don’t provide it, they’ll happily get it from tabloids, romance novels, The View, Tyra Banks or otherwise living vicariously through their single girlfriends. By playfully staying her source of that rush you maintain the position of stimulating her imagination. Married men, who were defeated before they committed, don’t think that elements of Game apply to marriage out of fear of upsetting their wives frame, when in fact being cocky & funny, neg hits and many other aspects of Game work

At this point you might be thinking, “Well, what the hell, I don’t want to feel rejection, why not employ buffers against it?” The main reason for embracing rejection is that rejection is better than regret. Scan back through this short list of buffers; how many of these have become greater, longer term problems for you than a briefly painful rejection would’ve been? Buffers also have a tendency to compound upon themselves in that one tends to dovetail into another, or more, until you no longer realize that they were originally rejection prevention methodologies and gradually become associated with your genuine personality.

The feminine plate spinning involves much more than sex though. Remember, attention is the coin of the realm in female society. The capacity to command attention determines self-esteem, peer status, sexual selectivity, and a host of other factors in a woman’s life, so spinning plates becomes more than just a “which guy am I gonna get with tonight” prospect. This dynamic and these factors are what makes women natural plate spinners.

At this point you might be thinking, “Well, what the hell, I don’t want to feel rejection, why not employ buffers against it?” The main reason for embracing rejection is that rejection is better than regret. Scan back through this short list of buffers; how many of these have become greater, longer term problems for you than a briefly painful rejection would’ve been? Buffers also have a tendency to compound upon themselves in that one tends to dovetail into another, or more, until you no longer realize that they were originally rejection prevention methodologies and gradually become associated with your genuine personality.

For it is sex that mixes together the genes of two people and discards half of the mixture, so ensuring that no child is exactly like either of its parents. And it is also sex that causes all genes to be contributed eventually to the pool of the whole species by such mixing. Sex causes the differences between individuals but ensures that those differences never diverge far from a golden mean for the whole species.

First, there was time to develop ideas independently, unlike the shouting and pitching in a group brainstorm. But there wasn’t too much time. Looming deadlines forced me to focus. I couldn’t afford to overthink details or get caught up in other, less important work, as I often did on regular workdays. The other key ingredients were the people. The engineers, the product manager, and the designer were all in the room together, each solving his or her own part of the problem, each ready to answer the others’ questions.

First, the team cleared a full week on their calendars. From Monday to Friday, they canceled all meetings, set the “out of office” responders on their email, and completely focused on one question: How should their robot behave around humans? Next, they manufactured a deadline. Savioke made arrangements with the hotel to run a live test on the Friday of their sprint week. Now the pressure was on. There were only four days to design and prototype a working solution. On Monday, Savioke reviewed everything they knew about the problem. Steve talked about the importance of guest satisfaction, which hotels measure and track religiously. If the Relay robot boosted satisfaction numbers during the pilot program, hotels would order more robots. But if that number stayed flat, or fell, and the orders didn’t come in, their fledgling business would be in a precarious position. Together, we created a map to identify the biggest risks. Think of this map as a story: guest meets robot, robot gives guest toothbrush, guest falls for robot. Along the way were critical moments when robot and guest might interact for the first time: in the lobby, in the elevator, in

Despite the differences in these two external personality patterns, borderlines and narcissists share a similar internal sense of low self-esteem, fear, anxiety, paranoia, and deep emotional pain from a sense of “not feeling good enough.” Both will also go to extremes to protect their emotional vulnerability. Most important, both use many of the same defense mechanisms: blaming, projection, devaluing, idealization, splitting, denial, distortion, rationalization, and passive-aggressiveness. Narcissists also use omnipotence, whereas borderlines will use acting out.

Almost all Masters and people of power suffer from too many demands on their time and too much information to absorb. If you can demonstrate the ability to help them organize themselves on these fronts to a degree that others cannot, it will be much easier to get their attention and interest them in the relationship. Do not shy away from anything menial or secretarial. You want person-to-person access, however you can get it. Once you establish a relationship, you will find other ways to continually hook them through their self-interest. Try to see the world through their eyes and ask the simple question of what it is they need most. Keeping their self-interest involved will only enhance any emotional connection they feel toward you. If you work on yourself first, as Faraday did, developing a solid work ethic and organizational skills, eventually the right teacher will appear in your life. Word will spread through the proper

The difference between watching a usability test live and hearing a presentation about it is like the difference between watching a sporting event while it’s happening versus listening to a recap of it on the evening news. Live games create memorable experiences; the evening news not so much. If you can’t get them to come, then settle for second best: include clips of highlights from tests in your presentations. If you don’t get to do a presentation, post a short clip (less than 3 minutes) on your intranet and send out email with an intriguing description and a link to the video. Even executives like watching short videos. Do the first one on your own time. When you do your first test, don’t ask for permission; just keep it incredibly simple and informal, and find volunteers for participants so it doesn’t cost anything. And try to make sure that something improves as a result. Pick an easy target to test—something that you know has at least one serious usability problem that can be fixed quickly without having to get a lot of people

Some affordances are perceivable, others are not. •  Perceived affordances often act as signifiers, but they can be ambiguous. •  Signifiers signal things, in particular what actions are possible and how they should be done.

Applying A/B testing is relatively straightforward once your hypotheses evolve into working code. Here’s how it works: take the proposed experience (your hypothesis) and publish it to your audience. However, instead of letting every customer see it, release it only to a small subset of users. Then, measure your success criteria for that audience.

Older items are pushed further away by the newer comments or entries. Offer a way for the user to get an immediate update or refresh. Also, they need to be able to scroll or review through the list to get to the older, unreviewed items. Offer publisher-curated streams that the user can view in addition to their own social stream.

A reserve currency is a currency that is accepted around the world for transactions and savings. The country that gets to print the world’s primary currency (now the US, but as we’ll see this has changed through history) is in a very powerful position, and debt that is denominated in the world’s reserve currency (i.e., US dollar-denominated debt now) is the most fundamental building block for the world’s capital markets and the world’s economies.

Nowadays we think mostly in terms of countries. However, countries as we know them didn’t come into existence until the 17th century, after the Thirty Years’ War in Europe. In other words, before then there were no countries—generally speaking, though not always, there were states and kingdoms instead. In some places, kingdoms still exist and can be confused with being countries, and in some places they are both. Generally speaking, though not always, kingdoms are small, countries are bigger, and empires are biggest (spreading beyond the kingdom or the country).

Throughout time, the formula for success has been a system in which well-educated people, operating civilly with each other, come up with innovations, receive funding through capital markets, and own the means by which their innovations are turned into the production and allocation of resources, allowing them to be rewarded by profit making. However, over the long run capitalism has created wealth and opportunity gaps and overindebtedness that have led to economic downturns and revolutions and wars that have caused changes in the domestic and world orders.

These periods of destruction/reconstruction devastated the weak, made clear who the powerful were, and established revolutionary new approaches to doing things (i.e., new orders) that set the stage for periods of prosperity that eventually became overextended as debt bubbles with large wealth gaps and led to debt busts that produced new stress tests and destruction/reconstruction periods (i.e., wars), which led to new orders and eventually the strong again gaining relative to the weak, and so on.

Because thinking about all of these determinants and their interactions is complex, I suggest that you keep the three big cycles in mind as the most important things to watch: 1) the cycle of good and bad finances (e.g., the capital markets cycle), 2) the cycle of internal order and disorder (due to degrees of cooperation and fighting over wealth and power largely caused by wealth and values gaps), and 3) the cycle of external order and disorder (due to the degrees of the competitiveness of existing powers in fighting for wealth and power).

If I were to add two more determinants to keep in mind, they would be 4) the pace of innovation and technological development to solve problems and make improvements and 5) acts of nature, most importantly droughts, floods, and diseases.

To be successful over the long run, a country must earn an amount that is at least equal to what it spends. Those that earn and spend modestly and have a surplus are more sustainably successful than those that earn and spend a lot more and have deficits. History shows that when an individual, organization, country, or empire spends more than what it earns, misery and turbulence are ahead.

In a period of inflation, when the aggregate price level is increasing, most prices tend to rise, though some will inevitably rise more than others. In a period of deflation, by contrast, when the aggregate price level is decreasing, most prices tend to fall, though again some will fall more than others. It should not be hard to see that the value—or price—of money in terms of goods and services moves in exactly the opposite direction as the aggregate price level. When the price level rises (in a period of inflation), the value of money falls; and when the price level falls (in a period of deflation), the value of money rises. (See figure 2-1.)

In principle, central bankers can use monetary policy in the pursuit of many different objectives. If they believe GDP is growing too slowly or that unemployment is too high, they can reduce interest rates in order to stimulate economic activity. Conversely, they can raise interest rates if they think inflation is too high or is about to become too high as a result of rapid and unsustainable GDP growth (overheating). They can also target a particular exchange rate, raising interest rates when their currency falls in value relative to other currencies, and lowering interest rates when it rises relative to other currencies. Or they can reduce interest rates (and expand the money supply) in times of financial turmoil to help stabilize the financial system. In practice, most central bankers are mindful of all these objectives—vigorous but sustainable GDP growth, low unemployment, low inflation, steady exchange rates, a stable financial system, and so forth.

Keynesians believe that as GDP rises, individuals and businesses will increase their levels of consumption and investment, thus driving GDP still higher. In fact, this dynamic will repeat itself again and again, as new consumption and investment cause GDP to rise, which in turn encourages still more consumption and investment, and so on. For convenience, imagine that the effect worked only through consumption. Suppose further that households consumed 80 percent of every new dollar of income and saved the rest. In this case, if the government initiated an additional $100 in deficit spending, the first-round effect would be for GDP (national income) to rise by $100. Faced with an additional $100 of income, households would spend 80 percent of it, or $80, which would thus increase GDP by another $80. Now, with another $80 of income, households would spend 80 percent of it, or $64, which would again increase GDP by the same amount. So far, GDP would have increased by $244 (i.e., $100 + $80 + $64), based on the government's original $100 in deficit spending. But the process wouldn't end there. The virtuous circle would continue to go round and round and round, and GDP would continue to rise, with each increment of growth equal to 80 percent of the one before (i.e., $100 + $80 + $64 + $51.20 + $40.96

one should not conclude from this discussion that they are all that matter. If expectations are fundamentally out of line with reality, they will ultimately be dashed. When, in the 1990s, American investors expected unprecedented performance from internet companies, they rushed out to buy internet stocks and dramatically bid up their prices. Eventually, however, when it became clear that the original expectations were overblown, the prices of internet stocks plummeted (i.e., the bubble burst) and many internet investors experienced a tough dose of reality. A similar, but even more devastating, boom and bust occurred in the United States less than a decade later, when reckless subprime mortgage lending and securitization—based in large part on expectations of ever-increasing housing prices—contributed to a massive real estate bubble, which ultimately precipitated the financial crisis of 2007–2009.

As one observer explained: “Take 1998 as an example: The growth rate of fixed [price] weight real GDP in this year was 4.5 percent if we use 1995 as the base year; using 1990 prices it was 6.5 percent; using 1980 prices it was 18.8 percent; and using 1970 prices, it was a stunning 37.4 percent!”10 The Commerce Department sought to address these problems by updating the base year frequently and, especially in the 1980s, by introducing a variety of adjustments for changes in product quality, such as the increasing speed of personal computers.11 By far the biggest reform came in 1996, when Commerce Department officials adopted a chained method in place of the traditional fixed-price approach for calculating real GDP.12 Under the chained method, every year became a base year, but only for years that were immediately adjacent to it. Officials could therefore calculate the change in real GDP from 1995 to 1996, from 1996 to 1997, from 1997 to 1998, and so on, and then link all the individual changes into a seamless chain. Because the base year was effectively updated annually, the chained approach did a much better job accounting for changes in the mix of goods and services sold in the marketplace. One unfortunate by-product, however, was that the components of GDP, after being deflated with a chained price index, no longer necessarily summed exactly to real GDP.

A more precise way to distinguish credits from debits on the financial account is to think specifically in terms of changes in assets and liabilities, where assets represent domestic claims on foreigners and liabilities represent foreign claims on domestic residents and institutions. Thus, a deposit held by a domestic resident in a foreign bank is an asset, whereas a foreign deposit in a domestic bank is a liability.

In principle, the key question is not whether a country's current account is in surplus or deficit, but rather what factors are driving the surplus or deficit—namely, demand for goods and services or demand for capital. Increased foreign demand for a country's goods and services will likely bolster both the country's current account balance and its currency, whereas increased foreign demand for a country's financial assets will likely cause the country's currency to appreciate even as its current account deteriorates. Precisely because it is difficult to disentangle these factors in practice, experts frequently disagree on how a particular country's current account surplus or deficit is likely to influence its exchange rate. In general, though, sustained current account deficits appear to be more typically associated with long-term currency depreciation than with long-term appreciation (and the opposite is generally true of sustained current account surpluses).

Determine your stop loss before you determine your lot size When I show you the formula later, you’ll understand why. A common mistake that most traders make is that they will determine their lot size first, only to determine their stop loss later on. The only way that traders can determine their lot size before their stop loss is that they don’t even bother to calculate it, to begin with. They set their lot size randomly based on a number that pops up in their head. When you trade randomly, you’re essentially gambling. You might as well go to the casino. It’s more exciting there. There’s free coffee there as well. Traders who trade larger time frames will generally have a wider stop loss as compared to traders who trade a smaller time frame because they need to take into account the longer-term volatility. No one size fits all level Each currency pair requires a different level of stop loss due to the difference in volatility and behavior. Some currencies would tend to trend longer than others, and some would range more often. If you set the same stop loss target, say 30 pips, you are essentially trading blindly.

Tyranny is a bullheaded short-term solution that springs from weakness. It works, to a degree, for control purposes but ends up poisoning the hearts of those living under it.

LOVE IS AN ILLUSION. Love is an enchantment that we cast upon ourselves. It is a spell that binds those under its own influence with self-hypnotism. And better for the illusion to be cast on the woman’s side than the man’s side. When someone, either man or woman, falls in love, what they are falling in love with is the image within their mind of what they desire and not the object in truth. Love is magic and frame allows a man to become a magician.

All losing trades are “business profits” for your broker. This is because your broker takes the other side of your forex trade. Although it is true that some retail forex brokers match up trade orders so that a trader with a buy trade order is paired up with a trader with a sell trade. However, the overwhelming majority of retail forex brokers do not do this. Unless you are a consistently winning trader, your broker will take the risk on your trades, and assume that your trades will lose money in the long run. This is not something that is widely discussed, but it is true. Your forex broker wants you to lose, because your losses are your broker’s profits.

There are basically two schools of traders, and you must decide which school fits your trading www.rasabourse.com The Fundamentals of Forex Trading rí personality. The first school is the school of fundamental analysis. Fundamental traders use economic reports and news reports as the basis for their trading decisions. Forex traders who have a fundamental approach will closely examine world events, interest-rate decisions, and political news. Fundamental traders are concerned with properly interpreting news, whereas the focus for the technical forex trader is quite different. The technical forex trader uses technical indicators (or “indicators”) to properly interpret price movement on a chart. The forex trader who adopts a technical, indicator-based approach will examine the price charts. So, while the fundamental forex trader is concerned with interpreting news and world events, the technical trader is concerned with interpreting price on a chart. What are technical indicators? Indicators are simply another way of looking at a market price. In much the same way that it is possible to examine the speed of a car in many different ways, it is possible to examine price charts in many different ways, with indicators. Just for a moment, consider how many different ways you may measure the speed of a car: Measured in kilometers per hour. Measured in miles per hour. Measured in the time it takes to travel one mile. Measured by the time it takes to accelerate to 60 mph. Measured by how quickly the car can stop. Likewise, there are many ways to look at price on a chart. There are more technical indicators than telephone call centers in India. WHAT IS NAKED FOREX? It can be very confusing for the novice trader, and this is one reason why naked trading, trading without indicators, can be liberating. When starting out, many traders focus on the indicator. This is completely understandable since nearly 90 percent of the forex trading books, the vast majority of forex sites on the Internet, and forex trading seminars focus on indicators and indicator-based trading. Indicators encourage “secondary thinking,” which is a real handicap for traders looking to acquire expertise. Secondary thinking involves analyzing the indicator, spending time considering where the indicator may go, rather than focusing on the market. Naked traders, by definition, focus on the market, which is very different. www.rasabourse.com 8 NAKED FOREX Focusing on indicators may be one of the primary reasons that some forex traders do not make money. Indicators can be confusing, unhelpful, and just plain wrong. In the next chapter we take a look at technical trading, and some of the tragic trading mistakes forex traders make, and how to avoid them by adopting the naked-trading approach. www.rasabourse.com CHAPTER 2 Avoiding a Trading Tragedy Out of intense complexities intense simplicities emerge. — Winston Churchill may have spent time, money, and effort learning about indicators. You may have learned through experience that trading with indicators can be very difficult. In some ways, trading with indicators makes it difficult to find profits. Perhaps a close look at why indicator-based trading systems have difficulty finding profits in forex is in order. All indicators are created from price data. This is what all indicators do to price data: Price data enters into an equation and is spit out as something else. Sometimes the end product is a squiggly line, sometimes a straight line, sometimes a color or a number; it depends on the indicator. The end result is always the same: The indicator changes price data via a formula. The form of this end result (the indicator) may vary, but the process is always the same. These very same indicators, based on price data, are meant to hint at future movements in the market. Stated another way, an indicator will suck in price data, massage and process these data, and then spit out a graphical representation of these data. Indicators offer price data in another form. Perhaps this new form of price data is easier to interpret; perhaps this new form of the price data will hint at what the market may do in the near future. All indicator-based trading systems are founded on the idea that price data is in a better form when presented as an indicator.

Traders pay millions upon millions of dollars for educational seminars, DVDs, website lessons and, yes, even books such as this one. The great hope for most traders is that there is a valuable indicator (or recipe of indicators) that will hint at where the market is headed in the future. Millions

The first problem is that you will notice many trade opportunities. If you are trading the daily chart and notice that you have a trade nearly every day, you probably have too many zones drawn on your chart. The zones should be more or less evenly spread out, and it may take some time for the market to reach these zones, and trigger a trade. Patience is important for the naked trader.

Under most circumstances this stop loss will not be hit. The calculation of this emergency stop loss is simple. 1. Subtract the resistance-level zone from the support-level zone. 2. Record the number of pips; this is the width of the consolidation box.

First, subtract support zone, 85.95, from the resistance zone, 88.23 (85.95-88.23 = 228 pips). Divide this amount by 2 (228 pips + 2 = 114 pips). Next, add 114 pips to the support zone, 85.95 to find the value for the emergency stop loss. 85.95 + 114 = 87.09, so the emergency stop is placed at 87.09 for the CAD/JPY four-hour last-kiss trade

Remember, the naked trader is not held hostage to indicators, so the naked trader has the ability to be nimble and jump into a trade just as the market is turning around, the naked trader does not have to wait

Once the market achieves the first profit target, at the nearest zone, the stop loss is moved to break even for the remaining position. This obviously reduces the risk for the remaining position. The position will either hit the second profit target or it will be stopped at breakeven.

Are you surprised at what you find? Sometimes making money is easier when you do not trade. Sometimes avoiding trades is just as important as taking trade opportunities when they arise. Goal: Learn to quickly identify zones on any chart.

However, it is possible to re-create the bank system. This is how you can do this: become accountable to someone. Find a trading buddy, your partner, a relative, anyone you respect. Offer them your trading statement each week. This is your report card. Report the risk for each trade. Be accountable to this person. If you take on too much risk (win or lose), your risk manager should reprimand you. Perhaps your “risk manager” will change your trading platform password so you are unable to trade for one week if you take on too much risk. You must learn to keep risk manageable if you want to consistently extract profits from forex trading. Changing Systems If you have a losing streak, you may become too careful or too reckless with your trading system. This is a common reaction to a drawdown. This often leads to a downward spiral. It is important to keep track of what you are doing. There are many ways to do this, but be most common way is to keep track of your trading. To make sure that you are not changing your trading rules, do one of the following: Take screenshots of your trades before you take the trade (the set up), during the trade, and after the trade is closed. You may also want to create a trading journal. This journal should include information such as why you decided to take the trade, the system you employed for the trade, your feelings about the trade, the result of the trade, and a rating on how well you applied the rules of your trading system to that particular trade.
